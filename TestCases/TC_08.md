# TEST CASE 08 #

## GOAL ##

Verify the application is responsive

## STEPS ##

### PRE-REQUISITES ###

Backend program is running - see readme.md file for instructions how to start it.  
Open Tabs.html in a browser

### STEP 1 ###

***Action*** Open the application on a larger monitor (18 inch or 21 inch, 15.6 inch if no larger monitor available)  
***Expected Result*** Application opens and displays normally

### STEP 2 ###

***Action*** Manually start reducing the size of the browser window  
***Expected Result*** Verify that the application is responsive, i.e. as the viewport is reduced below the standard
breakpoints of Bootstrap (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ for exact measures), the application
is automatically re-sized, and keeps it overall layout
